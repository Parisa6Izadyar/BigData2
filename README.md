# BigData_river_project 
Here, there is another Big Data project which is about 'water utility companies and in our increasingly water-scarce world', knowing future water availability is key. We'll present methods for predicting water levels in the Arno River, a crucial Italian river that flows through Tuscany, notably Florence and Pisa, and is vital for the region's water management and flood control.
Our original dataset comprises over 20 years of observations, capturing key hydrological variables: river water levels (hydrometry), average temperature, and average precipitation.
The challenge was to determine how features influence the water availability of each presented waterbody, gaining a better understanding of volumes to ensure water availability for each time interval of the year.
